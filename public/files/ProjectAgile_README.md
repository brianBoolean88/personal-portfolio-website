## 📖 Lore Highlights

### 🏢 Crescent Industries
A powerful corporation leading tech advancement, rumored to experiment on human subjects. Operates under public trust, hides brutal truths.

### 🧬 The Protagonist (You)
An escaped prototype cyborg from a hidden underground lab. You awaken disconnected from Crescent, haunted by fragmented memories and hunted by those who built you.

### ⚔️ Executive Antagonists
- **Yoru** (Yuito Sato): A once-noble samurai turned top Crescent enforcer.
- **Yamato** (Itsuki Sato): His brother, an archer-turned-cyborg with shattered memories and conflicted loyalties.

### 🔥 The Shima Crisis
A war 70 years ago in a peaceful farming nation — Crescent launched a massacre to seize the land. Only two legendary warriors survived: Yoru and Yamato. Both were "saved" and repurposed as cyborgs under Crescent’s control.
